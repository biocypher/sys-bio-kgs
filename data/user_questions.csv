What is the scope of this knowledge graph? Give me a brief summary of the biology represented.		
What are the inputs, regulators, and phenotypic outputs of this system?		
What are key compartments in the knowledge graph, and how are they related?		
Which are the most interconnected elements of the knowledge graph?		
For [element] in the knowledge graph, what are downstream pathways/interactions/phenotypes?		
For [elementA] and [elementB] in the knowledge graph, list all the reactions betweethem with directions (inhibiting/activating), kinetic parameters for modelling, relevant literature for the reactions, any gene expression data available.		
In how many ways is [elementA] connected to [elementB]? If [elementA] is upregulated, what would be expected to happent to [elementB]? How many parameters, nodes, connections are in the model? 		
Compare two pathways or models in the knowledge graph. What is the overlap of elements and interactions>		
Which regulators influence [element]?		
Generate lists of reactions/pathways involved in growth or defence from literature or public databases, analyse how growth and defence are interrelated and which trade-offs occur		out of scope
patient matching or clinical trial matching		out of scope
